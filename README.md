# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++.

## Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake on a game board. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat food items and grow in length without colliding with the boundaries of the game board or itself. The game continues until the snake collides with a boundary or itself.

This implementation of the Snake game consists of several classes:

- `Point`: Represents a point on the game board.
- `Snake`: Manages the snake's movement and size.
- `Food`: Represents the food that the snake needs to consume.
- `Board`: Represents the game board and stores the positions of the snake and food.
- `Manager`: Acts as the game manager and orchestrates the interactions between the other classes.


## How to Play

    Use the following keys to control the snake:
        w or Up Arrow: Move the snake up.
        a or Left Arrow: Move the snake left.
        d or Right Arrow: Move the snake right.
        z or Down Arrow: Move the snake down.
        q: Quit the game.

    Try to eat the food (@) to increase your score and snake length.

    Avoid colliding with the boundaries (*) or the snake itself ($).
